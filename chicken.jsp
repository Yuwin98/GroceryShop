<h3><B>Recipe</B></h3>
<p>Wash chickens and pat dry with paper towel. Using kitchen scissors, cut along both sides of the backbone and remove from both chickens. Turn chickens over and place, skin-side up, on a clean, flat surface. Press down firmly to flatten. Cover and set aside. Combine lemon juice, rind, oil, garlic, chili and herbs together in a bowl. Rub herb mixture into skin of both chickens. Heat hooded barbecue on medium. Place chickens skin-side up on oiled grill. Cook for 25 minutes. Turn over chicken and press down with spatula. Close and cook for a further 25 minutes or until skin is crisp and chicken is cooked through. Transfer to a chopping board, cover loosely with foil and rest for 5-10 minutes. Cut into pieces. Serve with lemon wedges.</p>
